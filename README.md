# Glass Identification Dataset -
The Glass Identification Dataset is a multivariate dataset introduced by the UCI
Machine Learning Repository. The dataset involves predicting the type of glass given a
number of physical properties. The dataset is a study of glass composition in forensic chemistry, and it's used for
testing classification algorithms. The goal is to classify different types of glass based on
their content. 

# Project Goals: 
Practice the basics of data cleaning, data partition, data normalization, and data visualization.
